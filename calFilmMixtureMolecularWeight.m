% The method used in uwsDropletEvaporationCode is mostly based on the single 
% component droplet evaporation model proposed by Abramzon and Sirignano (1989), 
% and the details of this method have been published and are available 
% online. (Mikhil et al. 10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.120878).

% The code consists of a main function, an ode45 function, an input file 
% and several other functions to evaluate the required thermophysical 
% properties, non-dimensional numbers etc. The program can also be readily 
% used to predict the evaporation behavior of any single component liquid 
% droplet by incorporating the required property values of the desired 
% liquids, and may be used for other bi-component liquids by making 
% minor modifications to the code. 

%% This function calculates the molecular weight of the vapor mixture in the film

function [mixtureMolecularWeight] = calFilmMixtureMolecularWeight(compOneMoleFraction_film, compTwoMoleFraction_film, ambGasMoleFraction_film, molecularWeightOne, molecularWeightTwo, ambMolecularWeight, calMethod)

%%  select the correlation
mikhil = strcmp(calMethod, 'mikhil');

%% calculate the molecular weight of the mixture in the film 

if mikhil 
       
    mixtureMolecularWeight = ambMolecularWeight * ambGasMoleFraction_film + molecularWeightOne * compOneMoleFraction_film + molecularWeightTwo * compTwoMoleFraction_film ;
    
end
